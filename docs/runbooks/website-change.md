# Website Change Runbook

Use for changes that affect the running site, Django code, templates, static
assets, migrations, production behavior, or user-facing content.

## Steps

1. Read `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.
2. Read relevant topic memory from `docs/memory/`.
3. Inspect the actual code/config before deciding implementation.
4. Before editing files, use `docs/runbooks/task-memory-triage.md`; if durable
   tracking is warranted, create or update the smallest relevant memory plan
   first.
5. Perform the `docs/runbooks/security-implementation.md` applicability check. If
   any trust boundary is touched, follow that runbook through implementation,
   tests, and closeout.
6. Make scoped changes.
7. Run required gates (activate your venv first):
   - `ruff check .`
   - `lint-imports`
   - `python3 tools/check_security_patterns.py`
   - `python3 manage.py test web`
   - `npm run typecheck`
8. Run targeted checks for the touched feature, including security negative tests
   required by `docs/runbooks/security-implementation.md`.
9. If TypeScript under `static/web/ts/` changed, run `npm run build:js` and commit
   the generated `static/web/js/*.js` assets.
10. If UI/layout changed, follow `docs/runbooks/ui-verification.md`.
11. Update `CHANGELOG.md`.
12. Update topic memory only for durable setup/rule/gotcha changes.
13. Update or clear `AGENT_HANDOFF.md`.
14. Commit the completed change locally.
15. Push your default branch to your GitHub remote and wait for CI to pass on the
    exact commit.
16. Deploy through the GitHub Actions `Deploy` workflow unless the user explicitly
    said not to deploy.
17. Live-verify the affected page/behavior.

## Notes

- Do not report completion from code inspection alone.
- If deploy is skipped by user request, say clearly what remains undeployed.
- Use local `./deploy.sh` only when the user explicitly requests it, GitHub
  Actions is unavailable, or emergency recovery requires it.
- When adding a Django app, register it in `INSTALLED_APPS`, add it to the scan
  roots in `tools/check_security_patterns.py`, and update the `deploy.sh`
  allowlist.
